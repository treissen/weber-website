Mostly finished with the exceptino of the services page that will contain forms, and submissions.
  - once I learn more backend I will finish this


This projet's goal was to make a multipage webside with very little javascript.


Things I learned during the process 
  - media queries and responsive design.
  - importance of uniformity, with a little variety in your page designs
  - background images
  - importance of file paths



things I could have done better
  - file structure and folders
  -html tags, instead of divs
    -aside
    -section
    -etc
